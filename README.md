# sysdoc
This is a small tech test type project where I was asked to 'improve the code' of the SyksDocOriginal.js.

The code pulls today's date, then calculates how many days there are from today's date until the holidays listed.

The code (with my changes) can be run on Codepen here:

My original changes are in sysdoc.js. The second file, sysdoc2.js, is where I attempted to create a function dedicated to the calculations so that it could be reused, but something didn't work with the jquery and it would break.

*As with other personal projects on my Github, I upload the database info knowing it's for test purposes only and just to show my code to potential recruiters.
